# MIPS_Implementation

Currently only 5 stage pipelined basic instruction processing engine is made here along with data forwarding and stall injection logic for data and control dependency
our Next target is to develop Out Of Order Executin with Reorder Buffer implementation so that the processor looks real and with multiple functional units.
So that now this single microprocessor turns in a superscalar processor. when addition of L1 , L2 , L3 caches in the backen of design.
Voila ---> We will get a single core processor typically used in Intel and AMD commercial CPU's.
